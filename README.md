ECG Anomaly Detection at the Edge using MAX78000
## Setup environment
1. install **pyenv**
   ```
   https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv
   ```
2. Creating the Virtual Environment
   ```
   $ cd <your/project>
   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ai8x-training.git
   $ cd ai8x-training
   $ pyenv local 3.11.8
   $ python -m venv .venv --prompt ai8x-training
   $ echo "*" > .venv/.gitignore
   $ source .venv/bin/activate
   (ai8x-training) $ pip3 install -U pip wheel setuptools
   (ai8x-training) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   (ai8x-training) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.7
   (ai8x-training) $ deactivate
   $ cd <your/project>
   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ai8x-synthesis.git
   $ cd ai8x-synthesis
   $ pyenv local 3.11.8
   $ python -m venv .venv --prompt ai8x-synthesis
   $ echo "*" > .venv/.gitignore
   $ source .venv/bin/activate
   (ai8x-synthesis) $ pip3 install -U pip setuptools
   (ai8x-synthesis) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Embedded Software Development Kit (MSDK)

   **Prerequisites**
   ```
   $ sudo apt update && sudo apt install libxcb-glx0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-shm0 libxcb-util1 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-render0 libxcb-shape0 libxcb-sync1 libxcb-xfixes0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb xkb1 libxcb1 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxkbcommon0 libgl1 libusb-0.1-4 libhidapi-libusb0 libhidapi-hidraw0
   ```

   **Download MSDK installer**

   <https://www.analog.com/en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/embedded-development-software/software-download.html?swpart=SFW0018720B>

   **Final Check**

   After a successful manual or MSDK installation, the following commands will run from on the terminal and display their version numbers:
   ```
   arm-none-eabi-gcc -v
   arm-none-eabi-gdb -v
   make -v
   openocd -v
   ```
   gen-demos-max78000.sh and gen-demos-max78002.sh will create code that is compatible with the MSDK and copy it into the MSDKâ€™s Example directories.

## Overview

In this project, I will explore the fascinating field of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing and classification, leveraging the power of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Autoencoder. My selected dataset for this endeavor is the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, a carefully curated collection of ECG signals designed specifically for diagnostic purposes. My main goal is to build a tiny Autoencoder model tailored to the task of detecting abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) signals at the Edge using MAX78000. 

The following sections will present the abnormal detection system for the edge devices. The designed model is trained, deployed, and verified on MAX78000 EVkit.

## Dataset Information
The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database is a collection of 14,552 ECG recordings sourced from Physionet's PTB Diagnostic Database. These ECG signals are categorized into two classes: normal heartbeats and those affected by cardiac abnormalities. The dataset is sampled at 125Hz, providing high-resolution data for in-depth analysis.

Let's delve into some essential details about the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database:

* Number of Samples: 14,552
* Number of Categories: 2
* Sampling Frequency: 125Hz
